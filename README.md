### **Virtual Machine And The Virtualization Concept.**

The **Viratualization** Concept was first developed in the **1960s** to partition large, mainframe hardware for better hardware utilization, In the early 2000s, VMware introduced its product for x86 servers called ESX Server, and Microsoft acquired virtualization technologies (Virtual PC and an unreleased product) in 2003. The technologies that enabled virtualization were widely adopted in the early 2000s.

### **What Is Virtualization**

Virtualization is software that creates an abstraction layer over computer hardware, allowing the hardware elements of a single computer to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs). Virtualization makes a single physical machine act like multiple, saving the cost of more servers and workstations. Cloud computing is a service that delivers shared computing resources and is powered by virtualization technology.

### **What Are The Problems The Virtualization Comes To Solve?**

Virtualization comes to solve several problems, including cost savings, improved efficiency, less downtime, and scalability. It eliminates costs for IT rooms, cables, and hardware. Virtualization also allows IT managers to make changes in one part of a computer system without affecting other parts. However, virtualization can also cause some problems such as VM sprawl, network congestion, server hardware failures, reduced VM performance and security issues.
